Pull Requests
------------
Err'body hatin' on legal :-1:, but gotta do it. Please sign the [**RethinkDB CLA**](http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/). :pencil2: :clipboard:

Once the CLA is signed, here are some helpful guidelines to keep in mind when contributing.  While following them isn't absolutely required, it does help everyone to accept your pull-requests with maximum awesomeness.

* :heavy_check_mark: **CONSIDER** adding a unit test if your PR resolves an issue.
* :heavy_check_mark: **DO** keep pull requests small so they can be easily reviewed. 
* :heavy_check_mark: **DO** make sure unit tests pass.
* :x: **AVOID** breaking the continuous integration build. 
* :x: **AVOID** making significant changes to the driver's overall architecture. We'd like to keep this driver in-sync with the overall architecture of the Java driver so both projects benefit from bug fixes and new features.

:headphones: **BONUS** check out the cool music-video wall. Listen to some music while you code your PR. =)
